## 🎯 The Problem

**Decision fatigue is real.**

- We face **35,000 decisions daily** — from trivial to life-changing
- Big decisions paralyze us with overthinking
- We often already know the answer, but struggle to trust our gut
- Traditional pro/con lists feel like homework

> *"Should I quit my job? Move cities? Start that business?"*
